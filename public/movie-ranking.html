<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO HIDHAYATHULLA</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 favorite movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>PUDHUPETTAI</h3>
<pr>A cult gangster film directed by selvaraghavan in which the director talks about the "survival of the fittest". Actor dhanush <u>lived as the character</u> and that is one of the reason for the success of this film. I consider it as one of the gratest gangster movies of all time. </pr>
<h3>ALAIPPAAYUDHEY</h3>
<p>If love story is an art then mani ratnam is as artist. This is one of my favorite love genre film directed by mani ratnam, madhavan played a wonderful role in this film. The cinematography and music are top notch which is also a reason for the success of this film.The <u>train proposal scene</u> and the cinematography is my favorite in this film </p>
<h3>Super Deluxe</h3>
<p>When it comes to art films,<u>super deluxe</u> is my favourite because of the hyperlink screenplay structure.A wonderful hyperlink screenplay film directed by "Thiagarajan Kumararaja". My favourite is the <u>orange and teal </u> colour tone which I consider as one of the best creative approach that no one in the kollywood industry have done before. Actor vijay sethupathi played the transgender role effortlessly and seamlessley. Samantha, fahad fazil, myskkin, ramya krishnan acted really well and good.</p>
